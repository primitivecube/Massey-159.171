# Question 1a

# for testing:
# print(int(1234.56))
# print("Nice Day".upper().split('A'))
# print(len('55.3')*10)
# print(15 % 2 == 0)
# print(">>%0.3f<<" % (3.1415926))

# answer:
# 1234
# ['NICE D', 'Y']
# 40
# False
# >>3.142<<

# Question 1b

# for testing:
# x = 1

# answer:
# y = ((3*x**3)-(5*x**2)+7*x+9)**0.5

# for testing:
# print(y)

# Question 1c

# answer:
# title = ['roof','walls','doors']
# colors = ['green','blue','red']
# for i in range(len(title)):
#   print("{} {}".format(colors[i],title[i]))

# Question 1d

# for testing:
# import math
# def volume(radius, length) : # calculate the volume of a cylinder
#   print(int(math.pi * radius**2 * length))

# print("Volume =", volume(2,10))

# def volume2(radius, length) : # calculate the volume of a cylinder
#   return int(math.pi * radius**2 * length)

# print("Volume =", volume2(2,10))

# answer
# volume() has a print() argument inside of it, but it does not have a return argument.
# So, when volume(2,10) is called by print(), it will run its internal print() argument, which
# evaluates to 125, but volume(2,10) returns 'None', so print("volume =", volume(2,10))
# will display 125 on a line, then Volume = None on the next line.

# To fix the error, inside volume(), replace print() with return.

# answer:
# for x in range(n): # x and n are not defined, this should be 'while True:'
#     if reply == valid_answers.lower() # reply should be 'reply.lower()', # .lower() can't be used on a list

# Question 6b

# answer:
# Searching for items in a list is a linear search, this means that the list indices are checked
# one at a time for a matching item, therefore the time it takes to find an item in a list is proportional
# to the number of items in a list. This property of list lookup times can be expressed as
# O(n) time complexity.

# Conversely, dictionaries have an almost constant lookup time (O(1) time complexity) regardless of
# the number of items in the dictionary, so long as the dictionary implements a good hash function,
# which makes collisions uncommon.

# Dictionaries achieve O(1) lookup times by using the item key as the key for a hash function,
# which generates an algorithmically random index that is stored in a hash table, along
# with the values associated with that item key. Therefore, when looking up a key in a dictionary,
# the hash of the key will provide its index, and the values for that key can be retrieved directly from
# the hash table without having to search the hash table linearly.

# Lists are ordered, and dictionaries are not ordered. This gives lists an advantage for operations that
# require order, such as preserving order when inserting or deleting values, sorting values into a
# sequential index, or iterating over values by sequential index.
