# Exercise B: Paper, scissors, rock
# Write a program that plays rock, paper, scissors.
# 1. Create a program that randomly prints 0, 1, or 2.
# 2. Expand the program so it randomly prints rock, paper, or scissors using if statements.
# 3. Add to the program so it first asks the user their choice.
# 4. Add conditional statement to figure out who wins â€“ the player or the computer?
# 5. Add to the program so that it asks the user if they want to play again.
